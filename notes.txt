Google Auth - In the Google Cloud Console > Credentials > Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
